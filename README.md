# Predictive Analytics Class

## COURSE DESCRIPTION: 
This course introduces different predictive models with a focus on real-world
applications and datasets. The course covers three primary topics: 
1) the analyses of time series data,
including estimation and inference for ARIMA models as well as more recent developments;
2) a collection
of other important models including Bayesian analyses, survival analyses, models for count data; 
3) the set of skills required to analyze real-world data, including data pre-processing, data type identification,
and various types of models for different data types. In addition, the students will also have hands-on
experience working with real-world data.

COURSE OBJECTIVES: 
Upon completion of the course, students should be able to
- Model and forecast time series data.
- Understand different data types and identify the correct model for data analysis in R.
- Deal with messy data that have missingness or censored observations.
- Feel comfortable with analyzing real-world data sets and providing business insights.

GRADING: There will be homework assignments, a midterm exam, and a final project. Numerical course
grades will be determined according to the following:
- (1) Homework: 20%
- (2) Midterm exam: 30%
- (3) Final project: 40%
- (4) Class participation: 10%
#### You may use the formula (2H+3M+4F+C)/10 
where H = homework average, M = midterm exam, F = final
project, and C = class participation. Letter grades will be determined from numerical grades as follows:
A+ A A- B+ B B- C+ C C- D+ D F
98 95 90 85 80 75 70 65 60 55 50 <50
